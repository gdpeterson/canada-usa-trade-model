# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canadaâ€“USA Trade Model

This is an interactive, scenario-based model for estimating future **Canadaâ€“United States trade volumes** based on economic, policy, climate, and geopolitical variables.

Built with **React + Recharts** and designed for use in **policy foresight workshops**, this tool helps users explore how different futures might affect Canada's trade relationship with the United States.

## ðŸ“Š What Does the Model Do?

The model estimates **Canadaâ€“U.S. trade volume (in Trillion USD)** for a given scenario using the following factors:

- **Tariff rate** (U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods)
- **Industrial policy misalignment**
- **Systemic friction** (e.g., economic instability)
- **Climate resilience investment**
- **Geopolitical realignment** (multipolarity vs. integration)
- **Export dependence**
- **Pandemic/disruption shock**
- **Sectoral trade vulnerability**

The tool includes several **predefined scenarios** (e.g., *Courage*, *Bobcaygeon*, *Locked in the Trunk of a Car*) and also supports **custom inputs** for user-designed futures.
